# Operations

This repo supports three deployment models: Docker container, Home Assistant add-on, and local Python dev.

## What a real deployment needs

- Python 3.11+
- `ffmpeg` on `PATH`
- writable `tmp/` and `cache/` directories
- outbound network access for Apple Music charts API, Anthropic/OpenAI, and optional Home Assistant

Music comes from live Italian charts (via yt-dlp) when `MAMMAMIRADIO_ALLOW_YTDLP=true`, otherwise from local `music/` files. If neither is available the playback loop rescues from the norm cache, then from bundled demo assets under `mammamiradio/assets/demo/music/` when present, and as a final fallback requests forced banter from the producer so the queue recovers without crashing or stalling on silence. Chart entries pass through a narrow content-hygiene filter at ingest that drops obvious non-music (podcasts, BBC comedy, audiobooks, news briefings) before they enter the candidate pool — see `mammamiradio/playlist/playlist.py::_NON_MUSIC_MARKERS`.

Downloads that fail `validate_download` (missing file, too-short duration, corrupt) are purged from the cache directory and added to a process-local denylist so the same track is not re-selected endlessly. The main producer loop, prefetch, and prewarm all short-circuit on denylisted keys via a bounded retry around `select_next_track`. The denylist clears on restart. Music quality-gate rejections (silence, post-normalization artifacts) do NOT denylist the source track — they drop the cached normalization only and rely on the 3-consecutive-rejection circuit breaker to recover. Log signatures:

```
INFO Rejecting non-music chart entry: BBC Studios - <title>
INFO Chart ingest: filtered N non-music entries
WARNING Skipping track due to invalid download (<track>): <reason>
WARNING Purged rejected cache file <key>.mp3: <reason>
DEBUG Skipping denylisted track (already rejected this session): <track>
```

## Required secrets and config

Environment:

- `MAMMAMIRADIO_BIND_HOST`
- `MAMMAMIRADIO_PORT`
- `MAMMAMIRADIO_ALLOW_YTDLP` (optional, enables live charts and yt-dlp downloads; enabled by default in HA addon and Conductor)
- `ADMIN_USERNAME`
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` or `ADMIN_TOKEN` — required for any non-loopback bind (see **Admin access model**)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (optional, used for TTS and as script generation fallback)
- `HA_TOKEN` if Home Assistant integration is enabled

Static config:

- `radio.toml`

## Runtime outputs

- `tmp/` rendered segments and temp assets
- `cache/` downloaded track assets

## Startup model

The intended local startup path is:

```bash
./start.sh
```

That script launches uvicorn with `--reload`, `*.toml` reload support, and `LOG_LEVEL` from the environment.

## Conductor

Shared Conductor scripts live in [`conductor.json`](conductor.json):

- setup bootstraps `.venv`, installs dev tooling, and links `.env` from `~/.config/mammamiradio/.env` when present, falling back to `$CONDUCTOR_ROOT_PATH/.env`
- run exports a workspace-specific port and tmp/cache dirs before delegating to `./start.sh`, and defaults `MAMMAMIRADIO_ALLOW_YTDLP=true`
- archive deletes `.context/conductor/`

## HTTP surface

`mammamiradio/web/streamer.py` is the single source of truth. `architecture.md` (sibling) has the full route table with methods. Summary grouped by access level:

Public:

- `GET /` (listener page; HA ingress serves admin)
- `GET /listen` (alias of `/`)
- `GET /stream`
- `GET /healthz`, `GET /readyz`, `GET /public-status`
- `GET /sw.js`, `GET /static/{filename:path}` (PWA assets)
- `POST /api/clip` (rate-limited, 1 per 10s per IP)
- `GET /clips/{id}.mp3` (no auth, for sharing)
- `POST /api/listener-request`, `GET /public-listener-requests` (sanitized feed for the on-page sidebar)

The read-only sidecar monitor in `scripts/stream_watch_server.py` is intentionally limited to `/public-status`, `/healthz`, and `/readyz` so it still works when admin auth is enabled.

Admin (require `ADMIN_PASSWORD` or `ADMIN_TOKEN` unless on loopback):

- `GET /admin`, `GET /dashboard`
- `GET /status`, `GET /api/capabilities`
- `GET /api/setup/status`, `POST /api/setup/recheck`, `POST /api/setup/provider-check`, `POST /api/setup/save-keys`, `GET /api/setup/addon-snippet`
- `POST /api/shuffle`, `POST /api/skip`, `POST /api/purge`, `POST /api/stop`, `POST /api/resume`, `POST /api/trigger`
- `GET /api/pacing`, `PATCH /api/pacing`
- `GET /api/hosts`, `PATCH /api/hosts/{host_name}/personality`, `POST /api/hosts/{host_name}/personality/reset`
- `POST /api/credentials`, `POST /api/track-rules`
- `GET /api/listener-requests`, `POST /api/listener-requests/dismiss`
- `GET /api/search`, `POST /api/playlist/add`, `POST /api/playlist/remove`, `POST /api/playlist/move`, `POST /api/playlist/move_to_next`, `POST /api/playlist/load`, `POST /api/playlist/add-external`
- `POST /api/hot-reload` — reload `prompt_world.py`, `transitions.py`, `fallbacks.py` then `scriptwriter.py` (leaves-first) in-place without stopping the stream. Requires `--workers 1` (importlib reloads only the worker that handles the request; multi-worker deployments get inconsistent results).

### Diagnosing provider fallbacks

`GET /status` returns a `runtime_status` object under the top-level response. It contains:

- `station_on_air` — listener-centric boolean that is true only when producer/playback tasks are alive, no listener-facing silence failure is active, and the session is not stopped.
- `health_state` — backward-compatible runtime health state for blocked tasks, listener-facing silence, paused sessions, and provider fallback summaries.
- `providers` — current `audio_source`, `script_provider`, and `tts_provider` with `primary_provider`, `current_provider`, `fallback_active`, `recovery_mode`, `retry_in_seconds`, and `action_guidance` fields per provider. `script_provider` populates the recovery fields so transient Anthropic errors read differently from circuit-breaker and `action_required` fallback; non-script providers keep those fields empty unless future recovery metadata is added.
- `recent_events` — last 10 provider switch/failover events with timestamps, reasons, and whether a fallback was active.
- `last_switch` — most recent provider change event, or `null` if no switches have occurred this session.
- `failover_events` — last 10 events where `fallback_active` was true.

The Engine Room card in `/admin` renders this as two tiers: station health ("On Air" / "Paused" / "Error") and provider health ("Primary" / "Auto-recovering" / "Backup active"). Structured log events (`provider_switch_event`, `provider_health_state`) are also emitted so log aggregators can alert on sustained fallback states.

### Detecting a not-working AI key

A key that is present but invalid (a wrong or revoked `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
is validated actively, so the operator sees it without waiting for a banter segment to fail:

- On startup (when any key is configured) and after a key-save, a single secret-safe
  `max_tokens=1` probe (`check_provider_keys`) runs in the background — fire-and-forget, so it
  never delays boot or the first audio. `POST /api/setup/provider-check` runs it on demand.
- The verdict is cached on the station state and exposed in `GET /api/capabilities`:
  `capabilities.anthropic_key_status` / `capabilities.openai_key_status`, and
  `provider_health.{anthropic,openai}.key_status`. Each is `"unverified"` (not yet checked, or a
  non-auth probe error such as quota/rate-limit/network), `"valid"`, or `"rejected"` (the
  provider actively refused the key with a 401).
- A `"rejected"` key reads in the Engine Room as a persistent **key not working — replace key**
  state, distinct from the transient time-based `anthropic_degraded` "suspended" fallback. When a
  rejected key is the only configured LLM key, `capabilities.next_step` steers toward replacing it.
- The listener side never surfaces key health; if OpenAI is valid the station keeps sounding live.

## Recommended production shape

There is no blessed platform in this repo, but the sensible shape is:

1. Run the app behind a reverse proxy.
2. Bind the app on a private interface.
3. Require `ADMIN_PASSWORD` or `ADMIN_TOKEN`.
4. Persist `cache/`, `tmp/` where practical.
5. Monitor app logs.

## Admin access model

Loopback (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`) is fully trusted — no credentials needed.

For any non-loopback bind (`0.0.0.0`, a LAN/Tailscale address, or an empty
`MAMMAMIRADIO_BIND_HOST`, which listens on all interfaces):

- **Standalone startup now fails** unless `ADMIN_PASSWORD` or `ADMIN_TOKEN` is
  set. This is a behavior change: earlier versions started without credentials
  and trusted private networks at runtime. If you bind to `0.0.0.0` in
  standalone mode, set a credential or startup raises a config error.
- **When a credential is configured, private-network trust no longer bypasses
  it.** A LAN/Tailscale client must present the credential; it is no longer
  auto-trusted just for being on a private network.
- **`ADMIN_TOKEN` is a header-only API credential** (`X-Radio-Admin-Token`). A
  browser cannot send it on plain navigation, so to open `/admin` in a browser
  on a non-loopback bind you need `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. Use `ADMIN_TOKEN` for
  programmatic/API callers (HA `rest_command`, scripts).
- **Credential-less private-network deployments are unchanged** — still trusted
  for reads and CSRF-guarded on writes. The HA add-on auto-generates an
  `ADMIN_TOKEN` at startup, so it is always in the credentialed path.

## Docker

```bash
docker compose up
```

The `Dockerfile` builds a standalone image with Python 3.11 and FFmpeg. The container runs as a non-root `radio` user. `docker-compose.yml` maps `.env` variables and mounts a persistent volume at `/data` for cache and temp files.

`ADMIN_TOKEN` is required in `.env` (the container binds to `0.0.0.0`).

## Home Assistant add-on

The `ha-addon/` directory contains a complete HA add-on scaffold. Users add the repo URL in HA Settings > Add-ons > Repositories, then install "Mamma Mi Radio" from the store.

The add-on entrypoint (`ha-addon/mammamiradio/rootfs/run.sh`) maps Supervisor-injected `$SUPERVISOR_TOKEN` to `HA_TOKEN`, auto-generates an `ADMIN_TOKEN`, reads add-on options from `/data/options.json`, and starts uvicorn.

The dashboard is accessible via HA ingress (sidebar). The first-run flow exposes the same setup checks there as every other run mode, and the stream URL can be played on any HA media player.

When HA context is enabled, the station reads the Home Assistant state snapshot opportunistically before banter/ad generation. It does not send every entity to the script prompt: telemetry/config entities, unavailable states, free-text helpers (e.g. `input_text`), and sensitive domains such as trackers, cameras, and alarms are filtered first. Resident presence (`person.*`) is kept as home/away only, with GPS and identity attributes stripped, so arrival greetings and the empty-home mood keep working without leaking location. The remaining entities are scored and capped before prompt assembly. The admin Engine Room shows the scored prompt slice and privacy filter counts under Home Assistant details; `/public-status` exposes only listener-safe Casa moments.

## Home Assistant pushed entities

When the HA integration is enabled (`ha_enabled: true` in `radio.toml` or the HA add-on), mammamiradio automatically pushes its playback state to HA after each segment transition and every 30 seconds. No operator configuration required — entities appear in **Developer Tools → States** within 30 seconds of startup.

| Entity ID | Type | State values | Key attributes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `media_player.mammamiradio` | media_player | `playing` / `idle` | `media_title`, `media_artist`, `media_content_type`, `media_position`, `media_position_updated_at` (playing only), `mammamiradio_segment_type`, `mammamiradio_listeners`, `mammamiradio_queue_depth` |
| `sensor.mammamiradio_segment_type` | sensor | `music` / `banter` / `ad` / `off` | — |
| `sensor.mammamiradio_listeners` | sensor | integer | `unit_of_measurement: listeners` |
| `binary_sensor.mammamiradio_on_air` | binary_sensor | `on` / `off` | — |

All four entities are labelled with the configured station name (`Mamma Mi Radio` by default): the media player's `friendly_name` is the station name itself (and it doubles as `media_artist` for non-music segments), while the sensors read `<station> Segment Type`, `<station> Listeners`, and `<station> On Air`. Entity IDs and the `mammamiradio_*` attribute keys stay fixed regardless of the display name, so existing automations and dashboards keep working.

**30-second cold-start note:** after a HA or addon restart, pushed entities reappear within 30 seconds via the heartbeat. Automations triggering on `state_changed` may miss the first segment after restart — add an `initial_state: playing` guard if needed.

**Lovelace media card:**

```yaml
type: media-control
entity: media_player.mammamiradio
```

**Automation example** (turn lights down when banter starts):

```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.mammamiradio_segment_type
    to: "banter"
action:
  - service: light.turn_on
    data:
      brightness_pct: 30
```

**Note:** pushed entities appear in Developer Tools → States but not in the HA entity registry (Integrations page). HA Assist requires a HACS integration for registry visibility.

## What is still not documented because it does not exist yet

- no systemd unit
- no launchd plist
- no nginx or Caddy config
- no Fly/Render/Netlify config (public preview deployment is a future idea — blocked on cost and music copyright)
