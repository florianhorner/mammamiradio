# Changelog

All notable changes to `mammamiradio` are documented here.

The current version source of truth is `pyproject.toml`.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- **PWA support**: Install Radio Italì as a mobile app from your browser. Manifest, service worker, and app icons included.
- **Lock screen controls**: MediaSession API integration shows song title, artist, and Radio Italì artwork on your lock screen. Play/pause works from lock screen and notification shade.
- **Install prompt**: Chromium browsers get a native install banner; iOS shows manual "Add to Home Screen" instructions.
- **Offline resilience**: Service worker caches the app shell. If you lose connection, you see an offline status and the stream auto-reconnects with exponential backoff.
- **Static file serving**: New `/static/` route serves PWA assets (manifest, icons) with path traversal protection. `/sw.js` served at root for service worker scope.
- **HA Ingress compatibility**: Service worker uses `endsWith`/`includes` path matching so caching works correctly behind Home Assistant's ingress proxy.
- Custom logo and favicon: retro radio with Italian flag stripe, Terracotta Sera palette
- Logo in READMEs, HA addon store listing (icon.png + logo.png), apple-touch-icon, OG tags
- go-librespot bundled in HA addon Docker image for Spotify Connect support
- HA addon runbook and addon-specific documentation

### Changed

- HA addon Dockerfile builds from local source (CI copies files into build context) instead of pip installing from git
- Improved producer segment production logging and error handling
- HA addon run.sh extracts all config options including claude_model and playlist_spotify_url

### Fixed

- Re-enabled `host_network: true` — required for go-librespot mDNS (Spotify Connect discovery). Admin endpoints protected by auto-generated `ADMIN_TOKEN`
- Fixed ingress double-prefix bug: `_inject_ingress_prefix` was rewriting JS string literals (e.g. `'/api/'`, `'/status'`) that the client-side `_base` variable already handles, causing all API requests to 404 behind HA ingress
- Sanitize HA entity state values before injecting into Claude prompts (truncate, filter injection patterns, wrap in data delimiters)
- Pin all GitHub Actions in addon-build.yml to SHA hashes (supply chain hardening)
- HA addon config.yaml schema uses `password?` type for secrets (masked in UI)

### For contributors

- 6 new tests: service worker route, manifest route, 404 for missing static files, path traversal blocked, ingress prefix rewriting for static paths and sw.js.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- **Run with Docker**: `docker compose up` and you have a radio station. No Python, no FFmpeg, works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- **Home Assistant add-on**: Install from the HA add-on store, configure your API key, and the radio appears in your sidebar. Hosts automatically reference your home state (lights, temperature, who's home) with zero HA configuration.
- **Dashboard works behind HA ingress**: The web UI detects its base path at runtime, so it works both at `/` and behind Home Assistant's ingress proxy.
- **Configure via environment variables**: Override station name, Spotify playlist, Claude model, and HA settings without editing `radio.toml`. Useful for Docker and add-on deployments.
- **Multi-arch Docker CI**: GitHub Actions builds amd64 + arm64 images on tag push, published to GHCR.

### Changed

- Admin tokens are now accepted only via the `X-Radio-Admin-Token` header. Query parameter auth (`?admin_token=...`) removed to prevent token leakage in browser history, server logs, and referer headers.
- API error responses no longer expose internal exception details. Generic error messages are returned to clients while full details are logged server-side.

### For contributors

- `.dockerignore` for clean Docker builds.
- `tests/test_config_env_overrides.py` covers all new env-var override paths (11 tests).
- Pinned production dependency lockfile (`requirements.txt`) with SHA-256 hashes via `pip-compile`.
- All GitHub Actions SHA-pinned to immutable commit hashes across all 3 workflow files.
- Added `.github/CODEOWNERS` requiring review for workflow file changes.
- Added gitleaks pre-commit hook for secret scanning before push.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- Home Assistant addon: run fakeitaliradio as a supervised addon with one-click install from the HA Add-on Store. Includes Dockerfile, config schema, and GitHub Actions build pipeline for amd64/aarch64.
- HACS custom integration: media player entity that auto-discovers the addon via the Supervisor API, shows current track info, and exposes the stream URL for relay to other speakers.
- Addon-aware config: automatic detection of HA environment via `SUPERVISOR_TOKEN`, persistent paths under `/data/`, and `options.json` secret injection.
- Ingress support: dashboard and listener pages rewrite URLs for HA's Ingress proxy, with auth handled by the Supervisor.
- Spotify headless auth: addon mode disables browser-based OAuth and falls back to client credentials for public playlist access when no cached user token exists.
- Tests for addon config detection, options parsing, ingress URL rewriting, auth bypass, and Spotify addon behavior.

### Changed

- `go_librespot_config_dir` is now configurable (addon uses `/data/go-librespot`).
- Non-local bind auth check skipped in addon mode (Supervisor handles auth).
- Log path references use `config.tmp_dir` instead of hardcoded `tmp/`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- One-click macOS launcher: `Start Radio.command` bootstraps venv, installs deps, starts the radio, and opens the dashboard. `Stop Radio.command` to stop.
- Search and add individual Spotify tracks from the dashboard.
- Load a new Spotify playlist by URL from the dashboard.
- Inline SVG favicon, OG tags, and `theme-color` on both listener and dashboard pages.
- Sharing instructions for listeners on your network in README.
- New API routes: `/api/search`, `/api/playlist/add`, `/api/playlist/load`.
- Ruff linting and formatting config in `pyproject.toml` with auto-fixed violations across all Python files.
- Mypy type checking config (lenient mode) to catch obvious type errors without blocking on untyped legacy code.
- Pre-commit hooks for ruff lint and format (runs on every commit).
- GitHub Actions CI workflow running ruff, mypy, and pytest on push/PR to main.
- Comprehensive test suite raising coverage from 30% to 63%.
- Automated dependency update infrastructure (Dependabot + merge workflow).
- `TODOS.md` for tracking deferred work items.

### Changed

- go-librespot default path changed from hardcoded Homebrew path to bare `go-librespot` (PATH lookup).
- Home Assistant disabled by default in `radio.toml` with empty URL.
- `start.sh` uses `.venv/bin/python` instead of system `python` for reliability.
- Dashboard layout widened to 1280px max-width with 3-column grid.
- "Purge Queue" renamed to "Clear Buffer" with descriptive tooltip.
- Station name corrected to "Radio Itali" with grave accent across listener page.
- Pinned ruff (0.9.10) and mypy (1.15.0) versions in CI to prevent surprise breakage from upstream releases.
- Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` with lint, format, and type-check commands.

### Fixed

- Playlist URL placeholder mismatch that prevented auto-populating the current playlist URL.
- Playlist input stays permanently disabled if network request fails.
- Search shows "No results" instead of cryptic error when Spotify is not configured.
- Route documentation, placeholder text, and UI hardening fixes.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- Dedicated repo docs for architecture, operations, troubleshooting, and contributing.
- Inline module, class, and function documentation across the Python application code.

### Changed

- Expanded `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` so setup, auth, fallback behavior, and runtime flow match the current code.
- Kept `audio.bitrate` as the canonical bitrate setting in user-facing docs.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- Start a local AI-powered Italian radio station with an admin dashboard at `/`, a public listener page at `/listen`, and a raw MP3 stream at `/stream`.
- Alternate songs with AI-written host banter and multi-spot AI-generated ad breaks, including bumper jingles, custom ad voices, and recurring campaign callbacks.
- Expose admin controls for shuffle, skip, queue purge, track removal, reordering, and "play next" from the web UI.
- Provide public station status plus admin-only logs and debugging details for queue depth, recent playback, generated scripts, and go-librespot output.

### Changed

- Prefer real Spotify playback through go-librespot when a user connects the `mammamiradio` device, but keep the station alive with liked songs, demo tracks, local files, yt-dlp, or placeholder audio when that path is unavailable.
- Throttle stream output to the configured bitrate so the dashboard, listener, and actual audio timeline stay aligned.
- Require admin auth when binding to a non-local interface, while keeping localhost development friction low.

### For contributors

- Add pytest coverage for config validation, scheduler pacing, ad-brand selection, campaign history, and ffmpeg-backed audio helpers.
- Ship a local dev entry point in `start.sh` plus template config in `.env.example` and `radio.toml`.
